# COVID-19-Prediction

With the massive outbreak of COVID-19, the prediction of COVID- 19 data has become a popular research topic since March 2020.

We employed different models to solve this prediction problem:

- linear and polynomial regression model
- Suspected, Infected, and Recovered (SIR) model (optimizing the parameters in differential equation by fitting the curves)
- LSTM model (neural network method)
- ARIMA model (common time series prediction method)

The results for prediction using these models are displayed and analyzed in the `paper` section.
